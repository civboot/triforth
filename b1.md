# b1 CPU: 8bit stack cpu supporting simultanious 16bit and 32bit instructions

## First, the rambling...
I've gone over and over in my head trying to get the J1 to be general purpose,
and I just can't. The primary issue is that I want:
- To _at least_ be able to access the full 16bit codespace
- Not have to do complicated switching of contexts
- I also really want the CPU instruction set to be able to operate on _either_
  16bit or 32bit words.

I've decided the J1 is not a good CPU to achieve this with a 16bit instruction.
Maybe when Civboot is 60 years old and all CPUs are running at least 32bits
(and we want 64bits) we can have a 32bit J1 with all the bells and whistles
we could want. Until then, the b1 should serve us nicely.

What is the b1? There are three important points:
- It is a stack-based CPU designed for Forth and Webassembly
- It supports either 16bit or 32bit instructions via the highest bit.
- It supports accessing immedate values with the second bit + an _index down_
  from the last call/jmp address.

This gives it 6 bits for ALU instructions (64 instructions).

The byte structure is as follows:

- DXXX XXXX - double mode, 0=16 bit (integer) mode, 1=32bit (double) mode
- D1XX XXXX - get immediate at `(CALL_SITE - XXXXXX*CELL_SIZE)`
- D0XX XXXX - ALU stack operation

The stack operations are split into how they impact the dstack (to make
the CPU simpler).

### Shrink 2 dstack (4)
- `set setr`: sets an address / register
- `zjmp zjmprel`: jmps on zero

### Shrink 1 dstack (16)
- `add xor or and shl shr`
- `eq lt lte`
- `drop nip`
- `jmp jmpind jmprel`
- `call callind`

### No dstack effect (12)
- `inv neg zeq`
- `get rget`
- `swap lrot rrot take`
- `ret`
- `jmpfip jmpr` affects fip (forth instruction ptr) register and jmps

### grow 1 dstack (not including literals) (3)
- `dup over tuck`
